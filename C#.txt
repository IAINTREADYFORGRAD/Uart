1. var:
   (1) determined by the compiler at compile-time
       e.g., var number = 5;             the type of 'number' is inferred as int
             var text = "Hello";         the type of 'text' is inferred as string
             var list = new List<int>(); the type of 'list' is inferred as List<int>
             
   (2) Implicitly-typed variables must be initialized
       e.g., x var key
             o var key = 0
